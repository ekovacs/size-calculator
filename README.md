# Secret Sauce Size Calculator

Calculate your size with ease!

## Background

Sizing is quite inconsistent and there can be great differences in fit and
measurement among brands. Size charts can help navigate the landscape when
shopping online.

Reading size charts is not always straightforward. The Secret Sauce Size
Calculator was born to address this. The calculator works based on size charts.

Size charts contain the measurements for each size label used by brands or
designers for garments sold. There are a large number of standard sizing systems
around the world.

## Concepts

### Size Charts

Size charts (also called size guides) are provided by manufacturers for their
brands and can apply to one or more apparel categories. Separate size charts
exist for women and men.

Size charts usually have the following properties:

* Brand or designer
* Product category such as dresses, pants, sneakers
* Size labels and physical measurements for those labels
* Measurement types: an apparel item can have multiple dimensions. For example
  a dress can have bust, hip, and waist, a jeans can have waist and inseam
  measurements.
* Size system: different countries use different size labels for the same
  physical measurements
* Sizing: alpha (S, M, L) or numeric (2, 4, 6)

## Running the Mock API

A mock API implementation with hard-coded responses can be found in the `api/` directory.
An example UI implementation can be found in the `frontend/` directory.

The mock API uses Node.js and also serves the example UI implementation.

Running the API:

    # Install nodejs if necessary
    # Build UI
    $ cd frontend && npm install && webpack && cd ..

    # Start the API
    $ cd api
    $ npm install
    $ npm start

Visit http://localhost:3000.

## Size Calculator API

The Size Calculator API is a simple REST API that exposes brands, categories and
the prediction as resources.

### List brands

Lists the brands that the calculator can calculate the size for.

```
GET /brands
Response: 200 (application/json)

{
    "brands": [
        {
            "key": "calvin-klein",
            "name": "Calvin Klein"
        },
        {
            "key": "florence-eiseman",
            "name": "Florence Eiseman"
        }
    ]
}
```

### List categories

Lists the categories that the calculator supports for a particular brand.
```
GET /categories?brand=calvin-klein
Response: 200 (application/json)

{
    "categories": [
        {
            "key": "dresses",
            "name": "Dresses",
            "measurement_type": "bust"
        },
        {
            "key": "jeans",
            "name": "Jeans",
            "measurement_type": "waist"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Get a prediction

Returns one or more size labels that most likely fit, based on a brand, category and measurement.

```
GET /prediction?brand=calvin-klein&category=dresses&measurement=32
Response: 200 (application/json)

{
    "prediction": {
        labels: ["S", "4"]
    }
}
```

If there is no meaningful size label, the API returns an error
with an informative message.

```
Response: 404 (application/json)

{
    "error": {
        "message": "Too large"
    }
}
```

## Back end

Backend is implemented using Spring boot (https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) providing the runtime framwork, dependency injection, and the framework for the REST API
Tests are using REST-Assured (http://rest-assured.io/).

## Building

This back end implementation uses maven as a dependency manager and build platform.
to compile issue commands:
```
 cd backend
 mvn clean package
```
to run it as a standalone app:
```
java -jar target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
